# Datasets

VGGFace2 is filtered by the criteria of images per class (N). Only labels with N>400 are selected. This assures better qiality score distribution within the classes of the train dataset.

From FRGC_V2 we have selected only ID-Document compliant images. Here we publish the corresponting list of filenames (without specifying their location in the original dataset).
